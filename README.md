# Install Tutorial

## Legit Game

- **Download**:  
  Download `h2m usermaps only` + `h2m mod only` torrents.

- **Setup**:  
  Put them in the root directory of your game.

- **Launcher**:  
  Run `H2M Launcher.exe` once.  
  It should move the files to where it expects them to be, but you can't launch the game from there.

- **Start**:  
  Run `h2m-mod.exe`, change your name, and join servers.

## Full Game Download

- **Simple Download**:  
  As simple as downloading the `full h1 + h2m mod` torrent and running `h2m-mod.exe` after.

## Server List

- **Server List**:  
  [http://api.raidmax.org:5000/servers](http://api.raidmax.org:5000/servers)

  Go to the link, click the `h2m` section.

- **Connect**:  
  Click on the `Connect` button on the right.  
  Copy the `connect` command with the IP.  
  Go back in the game, open your console with the `` ` `` key, paste the command, and press Enter.

  It should look like this: `connect 38.45.200.178:27060`
